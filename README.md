# Unity AI Helper
[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](README_CN.md)

Unity AI Helper is an AI-based Unity editor extension that revolutionizes development workflows through intelligent, dynamic code generation and execution.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Dynamic Code Compilation: Instantly generate, compile, and execute C# code within the Unity Editor
- ðŸ”Œ Unity API Integration: Direct access and manipulation of Unity APIs through dynamic code execution
- ðŸ¤– Intelligent AI Assistant: Advanced chatbot with context-aware Unity development support
- ðŸ›  Flexible Code Generation: Create complex scripts and components on-the-fly
- ðŸ§° Extensible Tool System: Adapt and extend Unity workflows with AI-powered code generation
- ðŸ’¬ Real-time Code Streaming: Generate and execute code snippets in real-time

## Code Execution Capabilities

The core power of Unity AI Helper lies in its advanced dynamic code execution system:

### Instant Code Generation and Execution

- **Dynamic Compilation**: Generate and compile C# code snippets instantly
- **Full Unity API Access**: Directly interact with Unity's entire API ecosystem
- **Context-Aware Generation**: AI understands your project context and generates appropriate code

### Example Workflows

```csharp
// Example 1: Bulk Object Manipulation
"Generate code to scale all objects in the scene by 2x"
// Generates and executes code that:
// - Finds all GameObjects
// - Applies scale transformation
// - Handles Undo/Redo operations

// Example 2: Custom Editor Tools
"Create a tool that randomly generates terrain features"
// Dynamically creates:
// - Custom editor window
// - Procedural generation logic
// - Integration with Unity's terrain system

// Example 3: Runtime Behavior Injection
"Add a component that makes all enemies follow the player"
// Generates a script with:
// - Pathfinding logic
// - Component attachment
// - Performance considerations
```

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Contextual Understanding**: AI analyzes your project structure and generates contextually relevant code
- **Safe Execution**: Integrated with Unity's Undo system for non-destructive modifications
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Transform ideas into functional code within seconds
- **Cross-Component Interaction**: Generate scripts that interact with multiple Unity systems

### How It Works

1. You describe your coding task in natural language
2. AI generates precise, compilable C# code
3. Code is dynamically compiled using Unity's Roslyn compiler
4. Executed directly in the Unity Editor
5. Provides real-time feedback and error handling

## Why Dynamic Code Execution Matters

- ðŸš€ **Unprecedented Flexibility**: Break free from static workflows
- ðŸ’¡ **Instant Prototyping**: Turn ideas into working code immediately
- ðŸ”¬ **Exploration and Learning**: Experiment with Unity APIs effortlessly
- âš¡ **Productivity Boost**: Reduce repetitive coding tasks
